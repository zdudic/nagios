This plugin check replication between FreeIPA servers. 
This first release is only for RH/OL/CentOS version 7. 
And the plugin required password of Directory Manager, 
hence what I suggest is to download this shell script, 
and enter the password in the "ipa_passwd" variable. 
One idea of hiding a password in a shell script is to 
use 'shc' tool which will convert a shell script into executable binary.
The plugin runs on a FreeIPA server, hence it's called by NRPE.
